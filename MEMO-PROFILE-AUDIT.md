## Revision Note (October 16, 2026): Supply-Scaled Burn Minimums

Burn minimums are no longer fixed whole-token amounts. Each minimum is a multiple of the current memo-mint reward, computed from the live `mint.supply` before the burn: `min_burn_amount(MINTS, supply) = MINTS × memo_mint::mint_amount_at_supply(supply)` (saturating multiply; see MEMO-MINT-AUDIT.md). Multipliers (constants renamed from `*_BURN_TOKENS` / `*_BURN_AMOUNT` to `*_BURN_MINTS`): create `MIN_PROFILE_CREATION_BURN_MINTS = 420`, update `MIN_PROFILE_UPDATE_BURN_MINTS = 420`. The whole-token check (`amount % DECIMAL_FACTOR != 0` → `InvalidBurnAmount`) was removed, so fractional amounts are accepted. `InvalidBurnAmount` stays in the enum but is never returned, so later error codes are unchanged. `BurnAmountTooSmall` now has a generic message, and a failed check logs the actual and required amounts in units. Success logs report units instead of whole tokens.

**New dependency**: memo-profile now depends on the memo-mint crate (`memo-mint = { path = "../memo-mint", features = ["cpi"] }`; the `mainnet` feature cascades as `mainnet = ["memo-burn/mainnet", "memo-mint/mainnet"]`). It is used only for the pure function `mint_amount_at_supply`: there is no CPI to memo-mint, and no new accounts, instructions or program ID checks. The curve is compiled into memo-profile, so if memo-mint's curve ever changes, memo-profile must be rebuilt and redeployed to keep its minimums in step with the actual mint reward.

- **Why**: as supply grows the mint reward falls to as little as 1 unit (0.000001 token), so fixed whole-token thresholds would eventually be out of reach for users who earn by minting, and amounts that are not whole tokens could not be burned at all (memo-burn now accepts any amount of at least 1 unit). Up to and including 10M supply the reward is 1 token, so every minimum equals its previous value (mainnet supply was about 8.73M at the time of the change); above 10M the minimums fall with each curve step, down to `MINTS` units at the last step.
- **Supply source**: the supply is read from the `mint` account, which is constrained to `AUTHORIZED_MINT_PUBKEY`, so a caller cannot pass a mint with a chosen supply.
- **Boundary / front-running**: supply can change between building and executing a transaction. Mints raise it (the minimum can only fall); burns lower it, and a burn that moves supply back across a step boundary raises the reward, and so the minimum, by one step (relatively largest at the low end of a decade, e.g. 0.1 → 0.2 token per mint around 90M). Crossing a second boundary would take burning a whole step's width of supply (at least 10M tokens), so in practice the minimum can move by one step at most, and the only effect is that a transaction fails with `BurnAmountTooSmall` and rolls back; no tokens are lost. Burning more than the minimum is always accepted, so clients should compute the minimum from a fresh supply and may add a buffer (for example, one step).

## Revision Note (October 13, 2026): Global Burn Statistics

memo-burn now records burn totals across all users in one `GlobalBurnStats` account (see MEMO-BURN-AUDIT.md, Revision 3), and `process_burn` requires it. Every instruction of this app that burns through memo-burn (`CreateProfile`, `UpdateProfile`) has a new **last** account, `global_burn_stats`: writable, typed as `memo_burn::GlobalBurnStats`, and checked against seeds `[b"global_burn_stats"]` and its stored bump under the memo-burn program. It is passed through to the burn CPI, where memo-burn checks it again. Existing accounts keep their order and this app's error codes are unchanged.

Clients must append the PDA (`memo_token_client::global_burn_stats_pda()`) to these instructions. Deploy this app only after memo-burn is upgraded and its global stats account is initialized.

## Revision Note (October 13, 2026): No Maximum Memo Length

This contract no longer limits the memo's maximum length, matching memo-mint and memo-burn:

- Only the 69-byte minimum is checked. The transaction size limit (1,232 bytes on X1 today) bounds the memo, so the contract adapts to future transaction-size changes without an upgrade.
- `MEMO_MAX_LENGTH`, `MAX_PAYLOAD_LENGTH`, `MAX_BORSH_DATA_SIZE` and the related Borsh size constants were removed, together with the decoded-size and payload-size checks. The app's own field limits (names, messages, content, etc.) are unchanged.
- `MAX_BURN_PER_TX` was renamed to `MAX_BURN_PER_INSTRUCTION` (it limits each burn instruction, not a whole transaction); the `BurnAmountTooLarge` message now says "per burn instruction".
- The `MemoTooLong` and `PayloadTooLong` errors were removed, so later error codes moved down:

<details><summary>Error code changes</summary>

| Error | Old code | New code |
|---|---|---|
| `MemoTooShort` | 6000 | 6000 |
| `MemoTooLong` | 6001 | removed |
| `InvalidTokenAccount` | 6002 | 6001 |
| `UnauthorizedMint` | 6003 | 6002 |
| `UnauthorizedTokenAccount` | 6004 | 6003 |
| `UnauthorizedProfileAccess` | 6005 | 6004 |
| `MemoRequired` | 6006 | 6005 |
| `InvalidMemoFormat` | 6007 | 6006 |
| `UnsupportedMemoVersion` | 6008 | 6007 |
| `UnsupportedProfileDataVersion` | 6009 | 6008 |
| `InvalidProfileDataFormat` | 6010 | 6009 |
| `InvalidCategory` | 6011 | 6010 |
| `InvalidOperation` | 6012 | 6011 |
| `InvalidUserPubkeyFormat` | 6013 | 6012 |
| `UserPubkeyMismatch` | 6014 | 6013 |
| `EmptyUsername` | 6015 | 6014 |
| `UsernameTooLong` | 6016 | 6015 |
| `ProfileImageTooLong` | 6017 | 6016 |
| `AboutMeTooLong` | 6018 | 6017 |
| `BurnAmountTooSmall` | 6019 | 6018 |
| `BurnAmountTooLarge` | 6020 | 6019 |
| `InvalidBurnAmount` | 6021 | 6020 (no longer returned since October 16, 2026) |
| `BurnAmountMismatch` | 6022 | 6021 |
| `PayloadTooLong` | 6023 | removed |

</details>

Code excerpts in the rest of this report reflect the code at the time of the original audit; where they show `MEMO_MAX_LENGTH`, `MAX_BORSH_DATA_SIZE` or `MAX_PAYLOAD_LENGTH` checks, those checks no longer exist.

## Contract Overview

### Purpose
The memo-profile contract enables users to create and manage on-chain profiles by burning MEMO tokens. Each profile operation (create/update) requires burning a minimum amount of tokens and attaching a structured memo payload. Profiles are stored as PDA accounts derived from user public keys, ensuring one profile per user.

### Key Features
- **Profile Creation**: Users burn at least 420 × the current mint reward (420 tokens while supply ≤ 10M) to create a profile with username, image, and optional bio
- **Profile Update**: Users burn at least 420 × the current mint reward to update any profile fields
- **Profile Deletion**: Users can delete their profile (free, returns rent)
- **Memo Integration**: All operations validated through Base64 + Borsh encoded memos at index 0
- **CPI to memo-burn**: Token burning handled through secure CPI calls
- **PDA Architecture**: One profile per user, derived from `[b"profile", user.key()]`
- **Network-aware**: Different program IDs and mint addresses for testnet/mainnet

### Profile Parameters
- **Username**: Required, 1-32 characters
- **Image**: Optional, 0-256 characters
- **About Me**: Optional, 0-128 characters
- **Minimum Burn (Create)**: 420 × the current mint reward (`min_burn_amount(MIN_PROFILE_CREATION_BURN_MINTS, mint.supply)`): 420 tokens (420,000,000 units) while supply ≤ 10M, falling with the emission curve down to 420 units at the last step
- **Minimum Burn (Update)**: 420 × the current mint reward (same formula, `MIN_PROFILE_UPDATE_BURN_MINTS`)
- **Fractional amounts**: allowed (no whole-token requirement)
- **Maximum Burn per burn instruction**: 1,000,000,000,000 tokens (inherited from memo-burn)
- **Token Decimals**: 6 (DECIMAL_FACTOR = 1,000,000)

### Account Space
- **Profile Account**: 614 bytes (includes 128-byte safety buffer)
- **Rent**: Paid by user on creation, returned on deletion

## Design Confirmations & Verification

### ✅ DESIGN CONFIRMATION #1: Mandatory Borsh+Base64 Memo at Index 0

**Design Intent**: ✅ **CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL – DATA INTEGRITY & AUDITABILITY**

```rust:284:345:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
pub fn create_profile(
    ctx: Context<CreateProfile>,
    burn_amount: u64,
) -> Result<()> {
    // Validate burn amount against the supply-scaled minimum
    let min_required = min_burn_amount(MIN_PROFILE_CREATION_BURN_MINTS, ctx.accounts.mint.supply);
    if burn_amount < min_required {
        msg!("Burn amount too small: {} units (minimum: {} units)", burn_amount, min_required);
        return Err(ErrorCode::BurnAmountTooSmall.into());
    }
    
    // ... validation ...

    // Check memo instruction
    let (memo_found, memo_data) = check_memo_instruction(&ctx.accounts.instructions)?;
    if !memo_found {
        return Err(ErrorCode::MemoRequired.into());
    }

    // Parse and validate Borsh memo data for profile creation
    let profile_data = parse_profile_creation_borsh_memo(&memo_data, ctx.accounts.user.key(), burn_amount)?;
```

**Transaction Structure Requirement**:
- Instruction `0`: `MemoProgram::Memo` (at least 69 bytes, Base64-encoded Borsh data; no contract maximum)
- Instruction `1+`: `memo_profile::create_profile` or `memo_profile::update_profile`
- Compute budget instructions occupy an instruction index too, so they must be at index 1 or later; one at index 0 makes the instruction fail with `MemoRequired`. Durable nonce transactions are not supported (the nonce advance would have to be at index 0)

**Why This Matters**:
1. **Data Integrity** – Profile data and burn amounts are carried in the same memo; the app checks its payload and memo-burn checks that each burn instruction's amount equals the memo's `burn_amount` (an equality check per instruction, not a cryptographic or one-time binding)
2. **Auditability** – All profile operations are permanently recorded on-chain
3. **Consistency** – Aligns with memo-burn and memo-chat patterns across the ecosystem
4. **Off-chain Indexing** – Easy to parse and index profile operations from transaction memos
5. **Replay Protection** – Memo contains user pubkey, preventing cross-user attacks

**Verification**:

```rust:539:566:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
fn check_memo_instruction(instructions: &AccountInfo) -> Result<(bool, Vec<u8>)> {
    // Get current instruction index
    let current_index = anchor_lang::solana_program::sysvar::instructions::load_current_index_checked(instructions)?;
    
    // Current instruction (memo-profile) must be at index 1 or later
    // to leave index 0 available for memo
    if current_index < 1 {
        msg!("memo-profile instruction must be at index 1 or later, but current instruction is at index {}", current_index);
        return Ok((false, vec![]));
    }
    
    // Check that index 0 contains the memo instruction
    match anchor_lang::solana_program::sysvar::instructions::load_instruction_at_checked(0, instructions) {
        Ok(ix) => {
            if ix.program_id == MEMO_PROGRAM_ID {
                msg!("Found memo instruction at required index 0");
                validate_memo_length(&ix.data, MEMO_MIN_LENGTH, MEMO_MAX_LENGTH)
            } else {
                msg!("Instruction at index 0 is not a memo (program_id: {})", ix.program_id);
                Ok((false, vec![]))
            }
        },
        Err(e) => {
            msg!("Failed to load instruction at required index 0: {:?}", e);
            Ok((false, vec![]))
        }
    }
}
```

**Verdict**: Memo enforcement is intentional, well-implemented, and critical for maintaining data integrity and auditability.

### ✅ DESIGN CONFIRMATION #2: Update Profile Reads from Memo (Fixed)

**Design Intent**: ✅ **CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL – CONSISTENCY WITH CREATE OPERATION**

**Before Fix** (Inconsistent):
```rust
pub fn update_profile(
    ctx: Context<UpdateProfile>,
    burn_amount: u64,
    username: Option<String>,    // ❌ From parameters
    image: Option<String>,        // ❌ From parameters
    about_me: Option<Option<String>>, // ❌ From parameters
) -> Result<()>
```

**After Fix** (Consistent):
```rust:388:391:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
pub fn update_profile(
    ctx: Context<UpdateProfile>,
    burn_amount: u64,  // ✅ Only burn_amount parameter
) -> Result<()>
```

**Implementation**:
```rust:412:442:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Parse and validate Borsh memo data for profile update
let profile_data = parse_profile_update_borsh_memo(&memo_data, ctx.accounts.user.key(), burn_amount)?;

// Call memo-burn contract to burn tokens
// ...

let profile = &mut ctx.accounts.profile;

// Update fields from memo data (validation already done in parse_profile_update_borsh_memo)
if let Some(new_username) = profile_data.username {
    profile.username = new_username;
}

if let Some(new_image) = profile_data.image {
    profile.image = new_image;
}

if let Some(new_about_me) = profile_data.about_me {
    profile.about_me = new_about_me;
}
```

**Why This Fix Matters**:
1. **Consistency** – Both `create_profile` and `update_profile` now use the same data flow pattern
2. **Data Integrity** – Memo data always matches actual profile changes
3. **Auditability** – Off-chain indexers can reliably parse update operations from memos
4. **Simplicity** – Cleaner API with fewer parameters
5. **Gas Efficiency** – Smaller instruction data (only burn_amount vs. burn_amount + all fields)

**Verdict**: This fix improves contract consistency and eliminates potential data mismatches.

---

### ✅ DESIGN CONFIRMATION #3: 420 × Mint Reward Burn Requirement

**Design Intent**: ✅ **CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL – ANTI-SPAM & VALUE ALIGNMENT**

```rust:31:46:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Token economics
pub const DECIMAL_FACTOR: u64 = 1_000_000; // Token decimals (6)
pub const MIN_PROFILE_CREATION_BURN_MINTS: u64 = 420; // Minimum burn for profile creation: 420x the current mint reward

// Maximum burn per burn instruction (consistent with memo-burn)
pub const MAX_BURN_PER_INSTRUCTION: u64 = 1_000_000_000_000 * DECIMAL_FACTOR; // 1 trillion tokens

/// Minimum burn in units for an operation priced at `mints` times the current mint reward.
/// The mint reward follows the memo-mint emission curve, so thresholds shrink as supply grows
/// (at supply <= 10M tokens the reward is 1 token, i.e. `mints` whole tokens).
pub fn min_burn_amount(mints: u64, supply: u64) -> u64 {
    mints.saturating_mul(memo_mint::mint_amount_at_supply(supply))
}

// burn amount
pub const MIN_PROFILE_UPDATE_BURN_MINTS: u64 = 420; // Minimum burn for profile update: 420x the current mint reward
```

**Rationale**:
1. **Spam Prevention** – a cost of 420 mint rewards (420 tokens while supply ≤ 10M) deters frivolous profile creation/updates
2. **Economic Alignment** – Burns reduce supply, benefiting all token holders
3. **Fair Pricing** – Same cost for create and update operations
4. **Meme Culture** – "420" aligns with crypto culture while being economically reasonable
5. **Flexibility** – Users can burn more if they want to contribute more
6. **Stays Reachable** – Pricing in mint rewards instead of whole tokens keeps the cost at "420 mints" as the reward falls toward 1 unit; a fixed 420-token minimum would eventually require hundreds of millions of mints. Fractional amounts are accepted, so the minimum is exact in units

**Validation**:
```rust:288:298:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Validate burn amount against the supply-scaled minimum
let min_required = min_burn_amount(MIN_PROFILE_CREATION_BURN_MINTS, ctx.accounts.mint.supply);
if burn_amount < min_required {
    msg!("Burn amount too small: {} units (minimum: {} units)", burn_amount, min_required);
    return Err(ErrorCode::BurnAmountTooSmall.into());
}

// Check burn amount limit
if burn_amount > MAX_BURN_PER_INSTRUCTION {
    return Err(ErrorCode::BurnAmountTooLarge.into());
}
```

**Verdict**: The 420 × mint reward requirement is well-considered, serving both economic and cultural purposes while preventing spam. The supply is read from the authorized mint; a burn by someone else between signing and execution can raise the minimum by at most one curve step, which only makes the transaction fail with `BurnAmountTooSmall` (see the October 16, 2026 revision note).

---

### ✅ DESIGN CONFIRMATION #4: PDA-Based One-Profile-Per-User

**Design Intent**: ✅ **CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL – SIMPLICITY & UNIQUENESS**

```rust:727:734:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
#[account(
    init,
    payer = user,
    space = Profile::calculate_space_max(),
    seeds = [b"profile", user.key().as_ref()],
    bump
)]
pub profile: Account<'info, Profile>,
```

**Why One Profile Per User**:
1. **Simplicity** – Easy to discover and retrieve (deterministic address)
2. **Identity** – One profile = one identity, aligning with social norms
3. **Gas Efficiency** – No need to index multiple profiles per user
4. **Security** – PDA derivation prevents account forgery
5. **Predictability** – Off-chain apps can calculate profile address without RPC calls

**Profile Derivation**:
```
Profile PDA = find_program_address(
    seeds: [b"profile", user_pubkey],
    program_id: memo_profile_program_id
)
```

**Update and Delete**:
```rust:789:794:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
#[account(
    mut,
    seeds = [b"profile", user.key().as_ref()],
    bump = profile.bump,
    constraint = profile.user == user.key() @ ErrorCode::UnauthorizedProfileAccess
)]
pub profile: Account<'info, Profile>,
```

**Verdict**: PDA-based single profile design is intentional, secure, and user-friendly.

---

### ✅ DESIGN CONFIRMATION #5: Profile Deletion Returns Rent

**Design Intent**: ✅ **CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL – USER-FRIENDLY ECONOMICS**

```rust:822:828:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
#[account(
    mut,
    close = user,  // ✅ Rent returned to user
    seeds = [b"profile", user.key().as_ref()],
    bump = profile.bump,
    constraint = profile.user == user.key() @ ErrorCode::UnauthorizedProfileAccess,
)]
pub profile: Account<'info, Profile>,
```

**Why Free Deletion**:
1. **User-Friendly** – Users can reclaim rent if they change their mind
2. **State Cleanup** – Encourages users to delete unused profiles
3. **Economic Fairness** – User paid rent on creation, gets it back on deletion
4. **Standard Practice** – Aligns with Solana/Anchor best practices

**Verification**:
```rust:483:501:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
pub fn delete_profile(ctx: Context<DeleteProfile>) -> Result<()> {
    let profile = &ctx.accounts.profile;
    
    // Store profile info for event before deletion
    let user_pubkey = profile.user;
    let username = profile.username.clone();

    // Emit profile deletion event
    emit!(ProfileDeletedEvent {
        user: user_pubkey,
        username,
        timestamp: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    });

    msg!("Profile deleted successfully for user {}", user_pubkey);

    // Account closure is handled automatically by Anchor through close constraint
    Ok(())
}
```

**Verdict**: Free deletion with rent return is intentional and user-friendly.

---

### ✅ DESIGN CONFIRMATION #6: CPI to memo-burn for Token Burning

**Design Intent**: ✅ **CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL – SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**

```rust:348:359:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Call memo-burn contract to burn tokens
let cpi_program = ctx.accounts.memo_burn_program.to_account_info();
let cpi_accounts = ProcessBurn {
    user: ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info(),
    mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),
    token_account: ctx.accounts.user_token_account.to_account_info(),
    user_global_burn_stats: ctx.accounts.user_global_burn_stats.to_account_info(),
    token_program: ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
    instructions: ctx.accounts.instructions.to_account_info(),
};

let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts);
memo_burn::cpi::process_burn(cpi_ctx, burn_amount)?;
```

**Why Use CPI Instead of Direct Burn**:
1. **Reusability** – memo-burn handles all burning logic consistently
2. **Global Statistics** – User burn stats are tracked in memo-burn contract
3. **Auditability** – All burns go through the same pathway
4. **Maintainability** – Updates to burn logic happen in one place
5. **Composability** – Other contracts can also use memo-burn

**Security Properties**:
- ✅ Type-safe CPI through Anchor
- ✅ memo_burn_program verified as `Program<'info, MemoBurn>`
- ✅ All accounts properly passed through
- ✅ No privilege escalation (user signs transaction)

**Verdict**: CPI to memo-burn is a sound architectural choice that promotes code reuse and consistency.

---

### ✅ DESIGN CONFIRMATION #7: Simplified Validation (Recent Fix)

**Design Intent**: ✅ **CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL – CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT**

**Before Fix** (Redundant):
```rust
// Validate category (must be exactly "profile")
if self.category != EXPECTED_CATEGORY {
    return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidCategory.into());
}

// Validate category length ❌ REDUNDANT
if self.category.len() != EXPECTED_CATEGORY.len() {
    return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidCategoryLength.into());
}
```

**After Fix** (Clean):
```rust:133:142:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Validate category (must be exactly "profile")
if self.category != EXPECTED_CATEGORY {
    msg!("Invalid category: '{}' (expected: '{}')", self.category, EXPECTED_CATEGORY);
    return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidCategory.into());
}

// Validate operation (must be exactly "create_profile")
if self.operation != EXPECTED_OPERATION {
    msg!("Invalid operation: '{}' (expected: '{}')", self.operation, EXPECTED_OPERATION);
    return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidOperation.into());
}
```

**Mathematical Proof**:
```
If string_a == string_b, then string_a.len() == string_b.len()
Therefore, length check is redundant when equality check exists
```

**Impact**:
- **Code Simplification**: Removed 4 redundant checks (2 in create, 2 in update)
- **Error Codes Reduced**: From 24 to 22 error codes
- **Logic Clarity**: Intent is clearer without duplicate checks
- **Performance**: Minor improvement (fewer comparisons)

**Verdict**: Removing redundant validation improves code quality without sacrificing security.

## Security Analysis

### 🔒 Critical Security Properties

#### 1. **Authorization & Access Control** ✅

**Create Profile**:
- ✅ User must be transaction signer
- ✅ Profile PDA prevents duplicate creation (one per user)
- ✅ User pubkey in memo must match transaction signer

```rust:159:169:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Validate user_pubkey matches transaction signer
let parsed_pubkey = Pubkey::from_str(&self.user_pubkey)
    .map_err(|_| {
        msg!("Invalid user_pubkey format: {}", self.user_pubkey);
        ErrorCode::InvalidUserPubkeyFormat
    })?;

if parsed_pubkey != expected_user {
    msg!("User pubkey mismatch: memo {} vs expected {}", parsed_pubkey, expected_user);
    return Err(ErrorCode::UserPubkeyMismatch.into());
}
```

**Update Profile**:
- ✅ User must be transaction signer
- ✅ PDA bump verification
- ✅ `profile.user == user.key()` constraint

```rust:789:794:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
#[account(
    mut,
    seeds = [b"profile", user.key().as_ref()],
    bump = profile.bump,
    constraint = profile.user == user.key() @ ErrorCode::UnauthorizedProfileAccess
)]
```

**Delete Profile**:
- ✅ User must be transaction signer
- ✅ Only owner can delete their profile
- ✅ Rent returned to owner

**Verdict**: Access control is comprehensive and properly enforced at all levels.

---

#### 2. **Data Validation** ✅

**String Length Limits**:
```rust:46:49:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
pub const MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH: usize = 32;
pub const MAX_PROFILE_IMAGE_LENGTH: usize = 256;
pub const MAX_ABOUT_ME_LENGTH: usize = 128;
```

**Validation in ProfileCreationData**:
```rust:171:197:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Validate username (required, 1-32 characters)
if self.username.is_empty() {
    msg!("Username cannot be empty");
    return Err(ErrorCode::EmptyUsername.into());
}

if self.username.len() > MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH {
    msg!("Username too long: {} characters (max: {})", 
         self.username.len(), MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH);
    return Err(ErrorCode::UsernameTooLong.into());
}

// Validate image length (optional, max 256 characters)
if self.image.len() > MAX_PROFILE_IMAGE_LENGTH {
    msg!("Profile image too long: {} characters (max: {})", 
         self.image.len(), MAX_PROFILE_IMAGE_LENGTH);
    return Err(ErrorCode::ProfileImageTooLong.into());
}

// Validate about_me length (optional, max 128 characters)
if let Some(ref about_me) = self.about_me {
    if about_me.len() > MAX_ABOUT_ME_LENGTH {
        msg!("About me too long: {} characters (max: {})", 
             about_me.len(), MAX_ABOUT_ME_LENGTH);
        return Err(ErrorCode::AboutMeTooLong.into());
    }
}
```

**Burn Amount Validation**:
```rust:288:298:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
// Validate burn amount against the supply-scaled minimum
let min_required = min_burn_amount(MIN_PROFILE_CREATION_BURN_MINTS, ctx.accounts.mint.supply);
if burn_amount < min_required {
    msg!("Burn amount too small: {} units (minimum: {} units)", burn_amount, min_required);
    return Err(ErrorCode::BurnAmountTooSmall.into());
}

// Check burn amount limit
if burn_amount > MAX_BURN_PER_INSTRUCTION {
    return Err(ErrorCode::BurnAmountTooLarge.into());
}
```

**Verdict**: All user inputs are thoroughly validated with appropriate bounds checking.

---

#### 3. **Memo Integrity** ✅

**Multi-Layer Validation**:

1. **UTF-8 Validation**:
```rust:571:575:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
let base64_str = std::str::from_utf8(memo_data)
    .map_err(|_| {
        msg!("Invalid UTF-8 in memo data");
        ErrorCode::InvalidProfileDataFormat
    })?;
```

2. **Base64 Decoding**:
```rust:577:581:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
let decoded_data = general_purpose::STANDARD.decode(base64_str)
    .map_err(|_| {
        msg!("Invalid Base64 encoding in memo");
        ErrorCode::InvalidProfileDataFormat
    })?;
```

3. **Size Limit Check**:
```rust:583:587:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
if decoded_data.len() > MAX_BORSH_DATA_SIZE {
    msg!("Decoded data too large: {} bytes (max: {})", decoded_data.len(), MAX_BORSH_DATA_SIZE);
    return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidProfileDataFormat.into());
}
```

4. **Borsh Deserialization**:
```rust:592:596:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
let burn_memo = BurnMemo::try_from_slice(&decoded_data)
    .map_err(|_| {
        msg!("Invalid Borsh format after Base64 decoding");
        ErrorCode::InvalidProfileDataFormat
    })?;
```

5. **Version Check**:
```rust:599:603:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
if burn_memo.version != BURN_MEMO_VERSION {
    msg!("Unsupported memo version: {} (expected: {})", 
         burn_memo.version, BURN_MEMO_VERSION);
    return Err(ErrorCode::UnsupportedMemoVersion.into());
}
```

6. **Burn Amount Match**:
```rust:606:610:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
if burn_memo.burn_amount != expected_amount {
    msg!("Burn amount mismatch: memo {} vs expected {}", 
         burn_memo.burn_amount, expected_amount);
    return Err(ErrorCode::BurnAmountMismatch.into());
}
```

7. **Payload Length Limit**:
```rust:613:617:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
if burn_memo.payload.len() > MAX_PAYLOAD_LENGTH {
    msg!("Payload too long: {} bytes (max: {})", 
         burn_memo.payload.len(), MAX_PAYLOAD_LENGTH);
    return Err(ErrorCode::PayloadTooLong.into());
}
```

**Verdict**: Memo validation is extremely robust with 7 layers of checks ensuring data integrity.

---

#### 4. **Mint Authorization** ✅

```rust:22:26:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
#[cfg(feature = "mainnet")]
pub const AUTHORIZED_MINT_PUBKEY: Pubkey = pubkey!("memoX1sJsBY6od7CfQ58XooRALwnocAZen4L7mW1ick");

#[cfg(not(feature = "mainnet"))]
pub const AUTHORIZED_MINT_PUBKEY: Pubkey = pubkey!("HLCoc7wNDavNMfWWw2Bwd7U7A24cesuhBSNkxZgvZm1");
```

**Validation**:
```rust:737:747:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
#[account(
    mut,
    constraint = mint.key() == AUTHORIZED_MINT_PUBKEY @ ErrorCode::UnauthorizedMint
)]
pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,

#[account(
    mut,
    constraint = user_token_account.mint == mint.key() @ ErrorCode::InvalidTokenAccount,
    constraint = user_token_account.owner == user.key() @ ErrorCode::UnauthorizedTokenAccount
)]
pub user_token_account: InterfaceAccount<'info, TokenAccount>,
```

**Security Properties**:
- ✅ Hardcoded authorized mint (prevents wrong token usage)
- ✅ Network-aware (different mints for testnet/mainnet)
- ✅ Token account ownership verified
- ✅ Mint/token account relationship verified

**Verdict**: Mint authorization is properly implemented with network-aware configuration.

---

#### 5. **Reentrancy Protection** ✅

**Solana's Account Borrowing Model**:
- Accounts can only be borrowed once (mutable) or multiple times (immutable)
- Attempting to borrow the same account twice in a transaction fails
- This provides built-in reentrancy protection

**Profile Account Protection**:
- Profile uses `init` on creation (can only be created once)
- Profile uses `mut` with PDA constraints on update/delete
- No possibility of reentering while account is borrowed

**CPI Safety**:
- CPI to memo-burn is called after all validation
- Profile update happens after successful burn
- No callbacks or hooks that could enable reentrancy

**Verdict**: Reentrancy is not possible due to Solana's account model and proper operation ordering.

---

#### 6. **Integer Overflow Protection** ✅

**Rust Safety**:
- Rust's default integer arithmetic panics on overflow in debug mode
- Production builds use wrapping semantics, but all arithmetic is validated

**Bounded Values**:
```rust:33:41:programs/memo-profile/src/lib.rs
pub const DECIMAL_FACTOR: u64 = 1_000_000;
pub const MIN_PROFILE_CREATION_BURN_MINTS: u64 = 420;
pub const MAX_BURN_PER_INSTRUCTION: u64 = 1_000_000_000_000 * DECIMAL_FACTOR;

pub fn min_burn_amount(mints: u64, supply: u64) -> u64 {
    mints.saturating_mul(memo_mint::mint_amount_at_supply(supply))
}
```

**Minimal Arithmetic**:
- No addition/subtraction on user-controlled values
- The only computation is the minimum: a constant multiplier times the mint reward (≤ 1 token), which uses `saturating_mul` and cannot get anywhere near `u64::MAX`
- Otherwise only validation comparisons
- Burn amount arithmetic handled in memo-burn contract

**Verdict**: No integer overflow risks; all values are validated and bounded.

| CPI Calls | Yes (to memo-burn) | Yes (to Token2022) |
| Memo Requirement | Yes | Yes |
| Test Coverage | 65 tests | 117 tests |
| Error Codes | 22 | 18 |
| Lines of Code | ~924 | ~414 |

**Analysis**: memo-profile is more complex due to profile management but maintains similar security standards.

---

### vs. memo-chat

| Aspect | memo-profile | memo-chat |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Complexity | Medium | High |
| State Storage | Profile PDAs | Group PDAs, Leaderboard |
| User Actions | Create/Update/Delete | Create Group, Send Memo, Burn for Group |
| Burn Requirement | Always | Optional |
| Test Coverage | 65 tests | Unknown |

**Analysis**: memo-profile is simpler and more focused than memo-chat, with clearer use cases.

## Dependencies Analysis

### External Crates

```toml:programs/memo-profile/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
anchor-lang = "0.32.1"      # ✅ Latest stable Anchor
anchor-spl = "0.32.1"        # ✅ Latest stable Anchor SPL
spl-memo = "6.0"             # ✅ Official SPL Memo
base64 = "0.22"              # ✅ Widely used, well-maintained
bs58 = "0.5.1"               # ✅ Standard base58 library
memo-burn = { path = "../memo-burn", features = ["cpi"] }  # ✅ Internal dependency (burn CPI)
memo-mint = { path = "../memo-mint", features = ["cpi"] }  # ✅ Internal dependency (pure function only, no CPI)
```

`mainnet = ["memo-burn/mainnet", "memo-mint/mainnet"]`: both internal crates follow the network feature, so a mainnet build uses mainnet IDs throughout. memo-mint is used only for `mint_amount_at_supply`, the emission curve value that sets the burn minimums; memo-profile never invokes memo-mint and holds no memo-mint accounts. Because the curve is compiled in, a change to memo-mint's curve requires rebuilding and redeploying memo-profile.

**Dependency Security**:
- ✅ All dependencies are from trusted sources
- ✅ Versions are pinned (no wildcards)
- ✅ No known vulnerabilities in used versions
- ✅ Minimal dependency tree (7 direct dependencies)

**Verdict**: Dependencies are well-chosen, up-to-date, and secure.

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Completed) ✅

1. **✅ COMPLETED**: Fixed `update_profile` to read data from memo instead of parameters
2. **✅ COMPLETED**: Removed redundant validation logic (category/operation length checks)
3. **✅ COMPLETED**: Added comprehensive unit tests (65 tests, 100% pass rate)

### Medium Priority (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add Profile Search/Discovery**:
   - Current: Profiles can only be found by user pubkey
   - Enhancement: Add optional indexing by username or other fields
   - Impact: Better UX for finding users
   - Complexity: Requires additional state and PDAs

2. **Add Profile Verification System**:
   - Current: No verification mechanism
   - Enhancement: Allow verified badges or trust scores
   - Impact: Reduces impersonation
   - Complexity: Requires admin system or governance

3. **Add Profile URI Field**:
   - Current: Image is just a string
   - Enhancement: Support for external profile URIs (IPFS, Arweave)
   - Impact: Richer profile content
   - Complexity: Low (just add a field)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Add Profile History**:
   - Track profile changes over time
   - Would require significant state overhead
   - Can be built off-chain using events

2. **Add Social Connections**:
   - Follow/follower relationships
   - Better as separate contract
   - Can reference profiles via PDAs

3. **Add Profile Metadata**:
   - Additional optional fields
   - Trade-off: More space vs. more flexibility
   - Consider carefully based on use cases

**Note**: The contract is production-ready as-is. These are enhancements for future iterations.

---

## Known Limitations (Intentional Design Choices)

### 1. One Profile Per User
**Limitation**: Users can only have one profile
**Rationale**: Simplicity, gas efficiency, clear identity
**Workaround**: Users can delete and recreate if needed

### 2. No Username Uniqueness Enforcement
**Limitation**: Multiple users can have the same username
**Rationale**: Uniqueness checking would require global state and be expensive
**Workaround**: Off-chain indexers can track username usage; users identified by pubkey

### 3. Limited Profile Fields
**Limitation**: Only username, image, and about_me
**Rationale**: Keep contract simple and focused
**Workaround**: Additional metadata can go in image field (e.g., JSON)

### 4. Burn Minimums Follow the Mint Reward
**Limitation**: Minimum for create and update is 420 × the current mint reward (420 tokens while supply ≤ 10M), so it changes with supply and is not a fixed token amount
**Rationale**: Spam prevention and economic alignment, while staying reachable as the mint reward falls
**Workaround**: None needed; clients compute the minimum from a fresh supply, and users can burn more if desired (a small buffer covers a one-step change near a curve boundary)

### 5. No Profile Transfer
**Limitation**: Profiles cannot be transferred to another user
**Rationale**: Profile = identity = non-transferable
**Workaround**: None; this is intentional

**Verdict**: All limitations are intentional design choices with valid rationales.

# Smart Contract Security Audit

## Administrative Operations (Completed)

### Global Index Management

* InitializeGlobalTopBurnIndex - Double validation with account structure constraints + function logic checks
* CloseGlobalTopBurnIndex - Double validation with account structure constraints + function logic checks

### Latest Burn Shard Management

* InitializeLatestBurnShard - Double validation with account structure constraints + function logic checks
* CloseLatestBurnShard - Double validation with account structure constraints + function logic checks

### Top Burn Shard Management

* CloseTopBurnShard - Double validation with account structure constraints + function logic checks

## User Operations (Completed)

### Token Transaction Operations

* ProcessTransfer - Token account constraints + user profile verification
* ProcessBurn - Token account constraints + user profile verification
* ProcessBurnWithHistory - Token account constraints + user profile and burn history verification

### User Profile Management

* InitializeUserProfile - PDA seeds ensure users can only initialize their own profiles
* CloseUserProfile - User identity verification

### Burn History Management

* InitializeUserBurnHistory - Account structure constraints + function logic double checks
* CloseUserBurnHistory - Account structure constraints + function logic double checks

## Open Operations (By Design)

* InitializeTopBurnShard - No admin restrictions, allowing any user to create, as intended by design

## Conclusion

All critical operations include appropriate permission validation, including account structure constraints and function logic checks. Administrative operations implement double-check mechanisms, while user operations ensure that only the correct users can access and modify their own data.

No permission check omissions were found, making the contract highly secure in this aspect.
